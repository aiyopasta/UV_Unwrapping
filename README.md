"TuttesTikTok.py" contains the main animation code. Note that it's really messy because it wasn't really meant for many other people to see and understandand, and some of it might be repetitive because it's just easier to do animations this way. There are many helpful comments scattered throughout though.

"TuttesExperiments.py" is just an experimentation file where I played around with the spring embedding stuff before I started animating.

The reason this is public is so others might take inspiration from my work and possibly learn from it. Please do NOT blatantly copy it and render out the animation to post on your own social media, or I'll stop making these codes public, and throw a banana at you.
